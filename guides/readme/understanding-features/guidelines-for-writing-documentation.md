# Guidelines for writing Documentation

## Starting Points for Documenting Our Core Mechanisms

1. **Identify the Core Mechanism:**
   * Define what constitutes the "core mechanism" of your web app. Is it a specific algorithm, data structure, or interaction pattern that drives the app's functionality?
2. **Target Audience:**
   * Who is this documentation intended for? Developers, testers, or internal stakeholders? Tailoring language and level of detail to the audience is crucial.
3. **Structure and Content:**
   * **Overview:** Briefly describe the core mechanism, its purpose, and its role within the overall application.
   * **Technical Details:**
     * **Components:** Explain the various components involved in the mechanism. Use diagrams or flowcharts for visual representation.
     * **Data Flow:** Describe how data is received, processed, and passed between components.
     * **Algorithms:** If applicable, explain the underlying algorithms or logic used for calculations or decision-making.
     * **Example Scenarios:** Showcase how the mechanism works in real-world use cases.
     * Best Practices and Limitations: Outline any specific guidelines or limitations associated with using the core mechanism.
     * **Troubleshooting:** Include a section on common issues and potential solutions.
4. **Maintainability:**
   * Use clear and concise language.
   * Include code snippets (with proper commenting) if relevant.
   * Maintain a consistent style and format.
   * Consider using version control for the documentation to track changes and updates.
5. **Additional Resources:**
   * Include references to any external libraries, frameworks, or technologies used within the core mechanism.

## Developer Friendly Documentation

Given your target audience and goals, here's a refined approach to documenting our core mechanism for developers:

1. **Focus on Efficiency and Clarity:**
   * **Start with a High-Level Overview:** Briefly explain the core mechanism's purpose and its role in the application.
   * **Prioritize Diagrams and Flowcharts:** Visual representations can quickly convey the overall flow and interactions between components.
   * **Use Concise and Technical Language:** Assume developers possess a solid understanding of web development concepts.
   * **Highlight Key Concepts:** Emphasize important data structures, algorithms, or design patterns used within the mechanism.
2. **Structure for Quick Reference:**
   * **Organize by Component:** Break down the core mechanism into its individual components. For each component, provide:
     * **Description:** Explain its functionality and interaction with other components.
     * **API Reference:** If applicable, include details on functions, arguments, and return values.
     * **Code Snippets:** Where relevant, include well-commented code snippets to illustrate specific functionality.
3. **Emphasize Future Development:**
   1. **Include Design Decisions and Trade-offs:** Explain the rationale behind specific design choices, highlighting potential alternatives considered.
   2. **Document Expansion Points:** Mention how the mechanism can be extended or customized for future features.
   3. **Provide References to Implementation Details:** Link to the actual codebase or relevant technical specifications for further exploration.
4. **Addtional Tips:**
   1. **Maintain a Glossary:** Define any non-standard terminology used within the documentation for clarity.
   2. **Consider Interactive Elements:** If feasible, include interactive diagrams or code examples that developers can manipulate for better understanding.
   3. **Gather Feedback:** Involve other developers in reviewing the documentation and provide avenues for them to suggest improvements.
