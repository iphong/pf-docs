# Render Element

## Data Structure

Within the context of PageFly, a web page builder, the following describes the choice between flat and nested data structures for representing HTML elements:

* **Data Model:**  The elements within PageFly represent the individual components of a web page, mapped to their corresponding HTML elements.
* **Data Structure Choice:** PageFly employs a **flat data structure** for several advantages.
* **Advantages of Flat Data Structure:**  Flat data organization simplifies locating and modifying specific elements.exclamation This eliminates the need for traversing complex nested structures, enhancing query and modification performance.

**Comparison with Nested Data Structure:**

While nested data structures might mirror the hierarchical nature of HTML markup, they can introduce inefficiencies when:

* **Querying specific elements:** Deeply nested structures require iterating through multiple levels to find the desired element, potentially affecting performance.
* **Modifying elements:** Changes potentially necessitate updates in multiple nested locations, increasing complexity.

### Element Data

```typescript
{
    id: string, // md5 hash generated by mongodb
    type: string, // the type of element eg. Button, Heading etc..
    data: {}, // the data for element eg. button's label
    children: [string] // the list of ids for recurring child elements
}
```

### Page Elements Data

The following code is the very basic structure of a page which consists of a root body element, and all of the element needed in its hieachy.

* Body
  * Layout
    * Section
      * Heading
      * Paragraph
      * Button

```typescript
[
    {
        id: '1',
        type: 'Body',
        children: ['2']
    },
    {
        id: '2',
        type: 'Layout',
        children: ['3']
    },
    {
        id: '3',
        type: 'Section',
        children: ['4', '5', '6']
    },
    {
        id: '4',
        type: 'Heading'
    },
    {
        id: '5',
        type: 'Paragraph'
    },
    {
        id: '6',
        type: 'Button'
    }
]
```
