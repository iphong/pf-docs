# Render Element

## Data Structure

### Flat vs Nested Data Structure

We are a web page builder and since web pages are all using HTML markups our elements are designed to represent HTML elements.

In PageFly, we choose to have a "Flat Data Structure" for several reasons. The biggest reason to choose this type of data structure is that it is easier to query for a specific element and make changes to it, rather than looping through deeply nested data.

### Element Data

```typescript
{
    id: string, // md5 hash generated by mongodb
    type: string, // the type of element eg. Button, Heading etc..
    data: {}, // the data for element eg. button's label
    children: [string] // the list of ids for recurring child elements
}
```

### Page Elements Data

The following code is the very basic structure of a page which consists of a root body element, and all of the element needed in its hieachy.

* Body
  * Layout
    * Section
      * Heading
      * Paragraph
      * Button

```typescript
[
    {
        id: '1',
        type: 'Body',
        children: ['2']
    },
    {
        id: '2',
        type: 'Layout',
        children: ['3']
    },
    {
        id: '3',
        type: 'Section',
        children: ['4', '5', '6']
    },
    {
        id: '4',
        type: 'Heading'
    },
    {
        id: '5',
        type: 'Paragraph'
    },
    {
        id: '6',
        type: 'Button'
    }
]
```
