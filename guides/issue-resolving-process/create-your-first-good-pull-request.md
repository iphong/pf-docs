# Create your first good Pull Request

## Setup your main branch

Depending on the release schedule, your implementation may be checked out from `staging` or `development` Add a prefix for your main branch following the below format

**`feat`**`-abc` or **`fix`**`-desktop-view`

Please create a PR from your main branch to the designated branch like so `feat-abc` to `development` Doing this will help all devs know which features are being implemented and keep them up-to-date if conflicts are araised.

## Do not push code directly to your main branch as you might not work alone

You and every member in your team should have separated branches (eg: `feat-abc-by-silver`). Daily PR to the main branch is recommended.&#x20;

## Do not merge the PRs

Let the seniors review first then they shall merge them into the main branch, not you
