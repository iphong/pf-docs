# Test-driven development (TDD)

### Introduction

I tended to write a detailed introduction about test-driven development (TDD) methodology. However, after googling "test-driven development" I see about 664,000,000 results. So, writing a new introduction about it is unnecessary.

Let me shorten it for you by an image and a short description.

{% hint style="info" %}
Test-driven development (TDD) focuses on an iterative development cycle where the emphasis is placed on writing test cases before the actual feature or function is written.

TDD usually follows the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:

1. Add a test to the test suite
2. <mark style="color:red;">**Red**</mark>: Run all the tests to ensure the new test fails
3. <mark style="color:green;">**Green**</mark>: Write just enough code to get that single test to pass
4. Run all tests
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Refactor**</mark>: Improve the initial code while keeping the tests green
6. Repeat
