# Review a pull request

### General

* Join the **git channel** on Slack to get updates
* Include the issue key if you are doing it
* PR description is **compulsory**, do not use the generated description, this helps give the reviewers a quick look on how you solve the problem
* Add tests where necessary

### Reviewing a PR

* Mr. Silver will be the **main reviewer**
* Within 2 hours (in working hours) since the time the PR is created, there should be an update
* If a PR takes a long time to handle, there will be a comment of **reviewing** from the main reviewer
* If a PR needs a demo, or complex, a review session is needed then PR owner shall proactively come to the lab ASAP to have the PR review. If failed, the PR will be **declined** after 4 hours.
* Sometimes, other core members (Dung, Duong and Kevin) will be added to review your code
* If the PR is good, it will be approved

### When a PR is ready to be merged

* One (the other does not raise a request changes) or both Mr. Silver and Mr. Phong approved

### When you are assigned to be a reviewer in a PR

* Review and update the PR within 2 hours
* If you have a comment, tag the PR owner so that they know and update their PR

### When your PR is requested changes

Not necessarily from the main reviewer, if you get **at least one request changes** (though other members might have already approved), follow the steps below

* Read the comments and make sure you understand why it is requested changes
* If you failed to update the PR within **4 hours**, it will be **declined** and the reviewer will reopen your issue
