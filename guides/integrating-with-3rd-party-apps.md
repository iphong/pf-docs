# Integrating with 3rd-party apps

## Clients encounter issues that could potentially be linked to 3rd-party apps

Developers need to verify whether the problem originates from PageFly or third-party apps.

* If the issue is associated with third-party apps, developers should generate an issue for Sun Do, instructing them to get in touch with the respective app provider for an updated snippet.
  * Sun Do should then create an issue for Silver, requesting an update to PageFly.
* If the issue arises within PageFly, developers should follow the standard procedure and submit a bug form.
