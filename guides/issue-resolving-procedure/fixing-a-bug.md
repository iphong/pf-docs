# Fixing a bug

1. **Check the title of the issue**\
   **If it is an automatically generated title, change it to a purposeful name indicating the actual issue after having a brief of it**
2. Change the status to In Progress before starting to do it
3. Submit a proposal solution and waiting for an approval
4. Create a PR and wait for reviewing
5. Resolve the issue once you are done with it
