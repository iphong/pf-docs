# 2. Find multiple solutions

Combining what we have found after [defining](1.-understand-the-issue.md#define-the-issue), [analyzing](1.-understand-the-issue.md#analyze-the-issue), and [framing](1.-understand-the-issue.md#frame-the-issue) the issue, we realize that the root cause of the bug is that _PageFly currently relies on the standard of Shopify themes to insert page assets and content into the layout template file which causes pages published by PageFly might lose styles on a non-standard theme_.

Let's start with the most direct way to resolve the most basic requirements. In this example, the most basic requirement is to _ensure the loading of page assets does not depend on how a Shopify theme renders the `</head>` tag_ ([step 1.1](1.-understand-the-issue.md#define-the-issue)).

{% hint style="success" %}
The first solution is to insert page assets before all `</head>` tags and replace all occurrences of the `{{ content_for_layout }}` tag with page content in the layout template file.
{% endhint %}

Besides, after a few tests, you can find that the browsers will automatically merge multiple `<head></head>` blocks into one when rendering. So, we can put page assets in a dedicated `<head></head>` block and insert it right after the `<html>` tag. This way, we don't need to care how non-standard Shopify themes render the `</head>` tag ([step 1.2](1.-understand-the-issue.md#analyze-the-issue)).

{% hint style="success" %}
The second solution is to wrap page assets in a dedicated `<head></head>` block and insert it right after the `<html>` tag.
{% endhint %}

Let's continue to the next step to evaluate each solution.
