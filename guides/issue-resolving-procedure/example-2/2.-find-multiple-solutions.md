Combining what we have found after [defining](1.-understand-the-issue.md#define-the-issue), [analyzing](1.-understand-the-issue.md#analyze-the-issue), and [framing](1.-understand-the-issue.md#frame-the-issue) the issue, we realize that the root cause of the bug is that _PageFly currently relies on the standard of Shopify themes to insert page assets and content into the layout template file which causes pages published by PageFly might lose styles on a non-standard theme_.
