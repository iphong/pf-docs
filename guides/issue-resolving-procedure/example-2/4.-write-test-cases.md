# 4. Write test cases

In this example, we will "fix pages published by PageFly losing styles on the storefront of a customer". In [step 1](1.-understand-the-issue.md), we understand that the problem occurs because the Shopify theme has two `</head>` tags. We also found that a similar problem might occur if a Shopify theme has multiple `{{ content_for_layout }}` tags.

Based on this understanding and the solution we choose in [step 3](3.-choose-one-solution.md), we can write the following list of test cases.

* _If a Shopify theme has multiple `</head>` tags, page assets must be inserted above all `</head>` occurrences._
* _If a Shopify theme has multiple `{{ content_for_layout }}` tags, all `{{ content_for_layout }}` occurrences must be replaced with page content._

Let's go to [step 5](5.-test-and-code.md) to update the existing test script with new test cases and code the solution.
