# 4. Write test cases

In this example, we will "fix pages published by PageFly losing styles on the storefront of a customer". In [step 1](1.-understand-the-issue.md), we understand that the problem occurs because the Shopify theme has two `</head>` tags. We also found that a similar problem might occur if a Shopify theme has multiple `{{ content_for_layout }}` tags.

Based on this understanding and the solution we choose in [step 3](3.-choose-one-solution.md), we can write the following list of test cases.

* _If a Shopify theme has multiple `</head>` tags, page assets must be inserted above all `</head>` occurrences._
* _If a Shopify theme has multiple `{{ content_for_layout }}` tags, all `{{ content_for_layout }}` occurrences must be replaced with page content._

The issue is related to a process that runs on the server to publish page assets and content into the layout template file of the active Shopify theme on customer stores. Because of that, we still have not found a way to test it automatically.

So, let's go to [step 5](5.-test-and-code.md) to code the solution and test it manually by running an app in the local development environment.
