# 3. Choose one solution

In this step, we will evaluate the ICE score for each solution we found in [step 2](2.-find-multiple-solutions.md).

### Evaluate the first solution

{% hint style="info" %}
The first solution is to insert page assets before all `</head>` tags and replace all occurrences of the `{{ content_for_layout }}` tag with page content in the layout template file.
{% endhint %}

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw.svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

{% hint style="success" %}
For this solution, we can:

* &#x20;_**Score 10 for the impact factor**_ because the solution can resolve both the specified case and a similar case that replaces the `{{ content_for_layout }}` tag with page content ([step 1.3](1.-understand-the-issue.md#frame-the-issue)).
* _**Score 8 for the confidence factor**_ because the solution might duplicate the loading of page assets on other non-standard themes having multiple `</head>` tags but not placed inside a `if...else` statement.
* _**Score 10 for the ease factor**_ because the implementation of the solution can be rapid.
{% endhint %}

### Evaluate the second solution

{% hint style="info" %}
The second solution is to wrap page assets in a dedicated `<head></head>` block and insert it right after the `<html>` tag.
{% endhint %}

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (1).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

{% hint style="success" %}
For this solution, we can:

* &#x20;_**Score 6 for the impact factor**_ because the solution can resolve only the specified case and it is a non-standard use of the `<head></head>` block.
* _**Score 6 for the confidence factor**_ because the solution itself is a non-standard use of the `<head></head>` block and might affect the SEO of the page.
* _**Score 10 for the ease factor**_ because the implementation of the solution can be rapid.
{% endhint %}

### Conclusion

After evaluating and scoring each solution, we see that the simplest and most effective solution is the first solution with an ICE score of 28.

Wait for your solution proposal to be approved before continuing to [step 4](4.-write-test-cases.md).

**What is the problem?**

* A Shopify theme might have multiple `</head>` tags placed in a control statement but PageFly only inserts page assets before the first `</head>` tag.
* PageFly does not handle Shopify themes having multiple `</head>` tags inside a control statement because the developer did not think a non-standard case like this is allowed by Shopify.
* We need to ensure the loading of page assets and page content does not depend on how a Shopify theme renders `</head>` and `{{ content_for_layout }}` tags.

**Ways to solve the problem?**

1. The first solution is to insert page assets before all `</head>` tags and replace all occurrences of the `{{ content_for_layout }}` tag with page content in the layout template file.
2. The second solution is to wrap page assets in a dedicated `<head></head>` block and insert it right after the `<html>` tag.

**Which solution do you propose?**

The simplest and most effective solution is the first solution because it can resolve both the specified case and a similar case that replaces the `{{ content_for_layout }}` tag with page content.
