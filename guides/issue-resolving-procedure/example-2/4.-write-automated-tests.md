# 4. Write automated tests

The issue is related to a process that runs on the server to publish page assets and content into the layout template file of the active Shopify theme on customer stores. Because of that, we still have not found a way to test it automatically.

So, let's go to [step 5](../processes/5.-start-coding.md) to code the solution and test it manually by running an app in the local development environment.
