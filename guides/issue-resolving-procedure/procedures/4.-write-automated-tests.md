# 4. Write automated tests

In this step, you should write automated tests for every use case. The test will immediately fail because we have not created the necessary code yet. Test-driven development is to write code to pass every designed test case until the end.

When resolving an issue for implementing a new feature, the feature already has UI, interactions, and individual use cases. Therefore, you can write tests for these visible things first.

Resuming the request to _“display a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign”_, regardless of which solution you choose in [step 3](3.-choose-the-simplest-and-most-effective-solution.md), we will need to create a stand-alone component and place it where the survey needs to show. The component will display the survey in the UI provided by the design team.

Because we already have the UI, we can create a test file that renders the component using the `mountWithApp` function and then use the `getByText` or other similar functions combined with the `toBeInTheDocument` or other similar functions to verify whether the survey and its content are displayed correctly.

The test will fail because we have not coded the required component yet. Now, you can go to the next step to code it.
