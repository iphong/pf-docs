# 2. Find multiple solutions

Let’s continue with the request to _“display a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign”_.

We understand that the purpose of this request is _to understand users’ needs to make PageFly fulfill exactly what users need for their Black Friday campaign_ ([step 1.1](./#id-1.1.-define-the-issue)) _to keep users using PageFly and using it frequently by exactly fulfilling their needs at any specified time_ ([step 1.2](./#id-1.2.-analyze-the-issue)) _and we will need to implement a solution that can flexibly collect users’ needs during a period and allow non-technical stakeholders to update the survey and see the results_ ([step 1.3](./#id-1.3.-frame-the-issue)).

{% hint style="success" %}
We need to allow non-technical stakeholders to see the results of the survey, so every solution needs to create an endpoint in the `pfserver` project. Responses from PageFly users will be sent to this endpoint to save to a dedicated collection in the database. Then, we need to create a screen in AC2 to display the user responses to non-technical stakeholders.
{% endhint %}

Now, let’s find solutions for _displaying a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign_.

We can start from the most direct way to implement the most basic requirements. In this example, after defining the issue, we need _to understand users’ needs to make PageFly fulfill exactly what users need for their Black Friday campaign_ ([step 1.1](./#id-1.1.-define-the-issue)). Thus, the most direct way to implement this requirement is to code a stand-alone component that directly displays the predefined survey in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show.

{% hint style="info" %}
The first solution is to code a stand-alone component that directly displays the predefined survey in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show.
{% endhint %}

However, this solution only addresses the display of the predefined survey. Complying with the deeper requirement _to keep users using PageFly and using it frequently by exactly fulfilling their needs at any specified time_ ([step 1.2](./#id-1.2.-analyze-the-issue)), if stakeholders need to edit or delete existing surveys or create new surveys, this solution will need to manually update the component and redistribute it to the live app server.

Therefore, we should not write the survey content directly in the component that displays the survey. Instead, we should define the survey content as a constant so that changing, deleting, and creating new ones can be done easier.

{% hint style="info" %}
The second solution is defining surveys and their lifetime as a constant in the `pfserver` project and including the active survey in the global configuration. Then, code a stand-alone component in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show. The component will look for any survey included in the global configuration and display it.
{% endhint %}

Although this solution is more flexible, each time surveys need to be changed, it still requires updating the constant and redistributing it to the live app server. This action does not comply with the deepest requirement _to implement a solution that can flexibly collect users’ needs during a period and allow non-technical stakeholders to update the survey and see the results_ ([step 1.3](./#id-1.3.-frame-the-issue)).

To solve this problem, we can move the storage of survey content from the code base to the database. We can then create a tool in AC2 for stakeholders to proactively change, delete, and create new surveys.

{% hint style="info" %}
The third solution is creating a dedicated collection in the database for saving surveys and their lifetime. Then, we will create an endpoint in the `pfserver` project for returning the survey content that should be shown at the current time (active survey). Finally, code a stand-alone component in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show. The component will automatically request the endpoint for an active survey and display it if available.
{% endhint %}

There might be more solutions but will mostly be similar. So, we can stop here and continue to the next step to evaluate each solution.
