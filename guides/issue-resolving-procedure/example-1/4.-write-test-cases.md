# 4. Write test cases

Resuming the request to _“display a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign”_, regardless of which solution you choose in [step 3](3.-choose-one-solution.md), we will need to create a stand-alone component and place it where the survey needs to show.

Suppose stakeholders want to show the survey in a modal on the dashboard screen, the first test case we can add to the list of test cases is:

* _After the app is completely loaded, a modal containing the survey must be automatically opened on the dashboard screen._

Depending on the chosen solution, you should expect how to implement it and continue adding test cases to the list. Suppose you choose the third solution, the following test cases can be added:

* _There are some surveys in the database but only one survey is active, the server endpoint for getting survey data must return only the active survey._
* _Nothing should be shown on the dashboard screen if the server response is empty._
* _The survey should be shown in a modal on the dashboard screen if the server returns one active survey._
* _The survey should be shown in a modal with pagination to navigate between multiple surveys on the dashboard screen if the server returns more than one active survey._

Let's go to [step 5](5.-test-and-code.md) to test and code until all test cases are covered.
