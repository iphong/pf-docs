# 4. Write test cases

Resuming the request to _“display a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign”_, regardless of which solution you choose in [step 3](3.-choose-one-solution.md), we will need to create a stand-alone component and place it where the survey needs to show.

Suppose stakeholders want to show the survey in a modal on the dashboard screen, we can add the following test cases to the list:

* _No modal should be opened if there is no active survey._
* _A modal containing one survey should be opened if there is an active survey._
* _A modal with pagination to navigate between multiple surveys should be opened if there is more than one active survey._

Depending on the chosen solution, you should expect how to implement it and continue adding test cases to the list. Suppose you choose the third solution, the following test cases can be added:

* _The server endpoint for getting survey data must return an empty array if there are some surveys in the database but no survey is active._
* _The server endpoint for getting survey data must return only the active survey as a single item array if there are some surveys in the database but only one survey is active._
* _The server endpoint for getting survey data must return all the active surveys as an array if there are several active surveys in the database._
* _The server endpoint for saving survey responses must return an error message if no user response or invalid data is posted to it._
* _The server endpoint for saving survey responses must save data and return a success message if a valid user response is posted to it._
* _The server endpoint for saving survey responses must save all data and return a success message if multiple valid user responses are posted to it._

Let's go to [step 5](5.-test-and-code.md) to test and code until all test cases are covered.
