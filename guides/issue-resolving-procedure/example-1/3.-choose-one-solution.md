# 3. Choose one solution

Let’s resume the request to _“display a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign”_. We will evaluate and score each solution we found in [step 2](2.-find-multiple-solutions.md) by **impact**, **confidence**, and **ease**.

### Evaluate the first solution

{% hint style="info" %}
The first solution is to code a stand-alone component that directly displays the predefined survey in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show.
{% endhint %}

Although this solution can resolve the issue, it is not flexible and not reusable because the survey content is hard-coded. In case the survey content needs to be updated or the stakeholders need to create new surveys, we will need to update the hard-coded survey in the `pfcore` project and redistribute the code to the live app environment.

{% hint style="success" %}
For this solution, we can:

* &#x20;_**Score 3 for the impact factor**_ because the solution can resolve only a specific case.
* _**Score 3 for the confidence factor**_ because the solution requires updating the frontend component and redistributing it if the survey content needs to be updated.
* _**Score 10 for the ease factor**_ because implementing the solution can be rapid.
{% endhint %}

### Evaluate the second solution

{% hint style="info" %}
The second solution is defining surveys and their lifetime as a constant in the `pfserver` project and including the active survey in the global configuration. Then, code a stand-alone component in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show. The component will look for any survey included in the global configuration and display it.
{% endhint %}

This solution is flexible because updating or removing a survey and creating new surveys is easy. However, it still needs to update the constant defined in the `pfserver` project and redistribute it to the live app environment.

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (4).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

{% hint style="success" %}
For this solution, we can:

* _**Score 6 for the impact factor**_ because the solution can resolve multiple cases, but changes need time to appear.
* _**Score 6 for the confidence factor**_ because the solution requires updating the constant definition and redistributing it if the survey content needs to be updated.
* _**Score 8 for the ease factor**_ because implementing the solution can be fast.
{% endhint %}

### Evaluate the third solution

{% hint style="info" %}
The third solution is creating a dedicated collection in the database for saving surveys and their lifetime. Then, we will create an endpoint in the `pfserver` project for returning the survey content that should be shown at the current time (active survey). Finally, code a stand-alone component in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show. The component will automatically request the endpoint for an active survey and display it if available.
{% endhint %}

With this **overall** solution, we only need to code **once** and use it for **a long time**. After distributing the code, all survey-related actions can be done in the database without the need for code redistribution. This behavior allows a survey to be updated or removed instantly. Creating new surveys is also easy and instant.

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (2) (1) (1).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

{% hint style="success" %}
For this solution, we can:

* _**Score 10 for the impact factor**_ because the solution can resolve multiple cases, and changes can appear instantly.
* _**Score 10 for the confidence factor**_ because updating existing surveys or creating new surveys can be done easily in the database without risks.
* _**Score 4 for the ease factor**_ because implementing the solution needs more time than the other solutions.
{% endhint %}

### Conclusion

After scoring all solutions, we can conclude that the third solution should be the simplest and most effective solution with the highest ICE score of 24 (the second solution and the first solution have ICE scores of 20 and 16).

Suppose the due date of the Jira issue to _“display a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign”_ is the same day you receive the issue. We should choose the first solution (which has the shortest implementation time) to ensure the distribution of the feature in time. But, after releasing the feature to the live app environment, you should ask the owner of the issue to create another Jira issue for you to implement the long-term solution (the third solution).

Similarly, suppose the due date of the Jira issue is the next day. In that case, we should choose the second solution (slightly better than the first one) to ensure the feature will be distributed in time and create another Jira issue to implement the long-term solution.

On the other hand, if the time-to-market is not too close, implement only the third solution, which is the simplest and most effective solution.
