# 4. Write automated tests

Resuming the request to _“display a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign”_, regardless of which solution you choose in [step 3](./#id-3.-choose-the-simplest-and-most-effective-solution), we will need to create a stand-alone component and place it where the survey needs to show. The component will display the survey in the UI provided by the design team.

Because we already have the UI, we can create a test file that renders the component using the `mountWithApp` function and then use the `getByText` or other similar functions combined with the `toBeInTheDocument` or other similar functions to verify whether the survey and its content are displayed correctly.
