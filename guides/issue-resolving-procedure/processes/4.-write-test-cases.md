# 4. Write test cases

In this step, you should write out a list of test cases. The reason for writing test cases before coding is it can help us apply [test-driven development (TDD)](../../test-driven-development-tdd.md) methodology quickly and easily.

This process sounds slow but can improve software quality in the long run. Having adequate test coverage, you don't accidentally change the functionality. It's much better to catch a bug locally from your test cases than from a customer in production.

TDD encourages writing testable, loosely coupled code that tends to be more modular. Since well-structured, modular code is easier to write, debug, understand, maintain, and reuse.

When you have a list of test cases that cover all possible use cases, you can get quick, real-time feedback during development. This reduces overall stress, improves efficiency, and increases productivity.

{% hint style="info" %}
After defining a list of test cases, you need to submit a solution proposal. Open [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8IcTnfy\_6Y92hScpEwUMpfWXQengWYQtxPXiXPbmStBWilw/viewform), fill in the information you found in [step 1](1.-understand-the-issue.md), [step 2](2.-find-multiple-solutions.md), [step 3](3.-choose-one-solution.md), and [step 4](4.-write-test-cases.md) then submit the form.

You **don't need to wait for your solution proposal to be approved** before continuing to step 5. The submission is to **ensure transparent information** and will be used for reference if any problem occurs.

While you don't need to wait for the solution proposal to be approved before implementing, a pull request missing a solution proposal submission will not be reviewed.
