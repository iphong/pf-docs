# 4. Write test cases

In this step, you should write out a list of test cases. The reason for writing test cases before coding is it can help us apply [test-driven development (TDD)](../../test-driven-development-tdd.md) methodology quickly and easily.

This process sounds slow but can improve software quality in the long run. Having adequate test coverage, you don't accidentally change the functionality. It's much better to catch a bug locally from your test cases than from a customer in production.

TDD encourages writing testable, loosely coupled code that tends to be more modular. Since well-structured, modular code is easier to write, debug, understand, maintain, and reuse.

When you have a list of test cases that cover all possible use cases, you can get quick, real-time feedback during development. This reduces overall stress, improves efficiency, and increases productivity.

After completing the list of test cases for the chosen solution, you can go to [step 5](5.-test-and-code.md), create a test script for the first test case, write the simplest code to pass the test, refactor the code to meet standards while keeping the test passes, and repeat the cycle until all test cases are covered.

{% hint style="info" %}
After defining a list of test cases, you need to submit a solution proposal. Open [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8IcTnfy\_6Y92hScpEwUMpfWXQengWYQtxPXiXPbmStBWilw/viewform), fill in the information you found in [step 1](1.-understand-the-issue.md), [step 2](2.-find-multiple-solutions.md), [step 3](3.-choose-one-solution.md), and [step 4](4.-write-test-cases.md) then submit the form. Wait for your solution proposal to be approved before continuing to [step 5](5.-test-and-code.md).
