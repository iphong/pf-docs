# 2. Find at least two solutions

After understanding the issue, it’s time to find feasible solutions. If the time is limited, you should try to find at least two solutions.

{% hint style="success" %}
The first thing we need to keep in mind when finding solutions is the **stability** of the app. Therefore, every solution should be **independent** and **not affect** other functionalities.
{% endhint %}

Let’s continue with the request to _“display a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign”_. We understand that the primary purpose of this request is _to understand users’ needs to make PageFly fulfill exactly what users need for their Black Friday campaign_ ([step 1.1](1.-understand-the-issue.md#id-1.1.-define-the-issue)) _to keep users using PageFly and using it frequently by exactly fulfilling their needs at any specified time_ ([step 1.2](1.-understand-the-issue.md#id-1.2.-analyze-the-issue)) _and we will need to implement a solution that can flexibly collect users’ needs during a period and allow non-technical stakeholders to see the results_ ([step 1.3](1.-understand-the-issue.md#id-1.3.-frame-the-issue)).

{% hint style="info" %}
We need to allow non-technical stakeholders to see the results of the survey, so every solution needs to create an endpoint in the `pfserver` project. Responses from PageFly users will be sent to this endpoint to save to a dedicated collection in the database. Then, we need to create a new screen in AC2 to display the user responses to non-technical stakeholders.
{% endhint %}

Now, let’s find solutions for _displaying a survey to PageFly users to collect their needs for the Black Friday campaign_.

{% hint style="info" %}
The first solution is to code a stand-alone component that displays the predefined survey in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The second solution is defining the predefined survey as a constant in the `pfserver` project and including it in the global configuration. Then, code a stand-alone component in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show. The component will look for any survey included in the global configuration and display it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The third solution is creating a dedicated collection in the database for saving surveys and their lifetime. We will insert the predefined survey into this collection as the first document.

Then, we will create an endpoint in the `pfserver` project for returning the survey content that should be shown at the current time (active survey).

Finally, code a stand-alone component in the `pfcore` project and place it where the survey needs to show. The component will automatically request the endpoint for an active survey and display it if available.
{% endhint %}

Now, we can continue to the next step to evaluate each solution to choose the simplest and most effective one.
