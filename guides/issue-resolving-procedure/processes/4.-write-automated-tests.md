# 4. Write automated tests

In this step, you should write automated tests for every use case. The test will immediately fail because we have not created the necessary code yet. Test-driven development is to write code to pass every designed test case until the end.

When resolving an issue for implementing a new feature, the feature already has UI, interactions, and individual use cases. Therefore, you can write tests for these visible things first.

The test will fail because we have not coded the required component yet. Now, you can go to the next step to code it.

{% content-ref url="../example-1/" %}
[example-1](../example-1/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
