# 4. Write automated tests

In this step, you should write automated tests for every use case. The test will immediately fail because we have not created the necessary code yet. Test-driven development is to write code to pass every designed test case until the end.

When resolving an issue for implementing a feature, the feature should already have UI, interactions, and individual use cases. Therefore, you can write tests for these visible things before coding the required components.
