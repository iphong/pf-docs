# 3. Choose one solution

{% hint style="info" %}
In software development, a **simple** solution can save a lot of coding, understanding, and debugging hours, not only for the developer who implements it but also for other developers who maintain it later.
{% endhint %}

We should rely on **flexibility**, **reusability**, and **simplicity** to evaluate and score each solution by **impact**, **confidence**, and **ease** (the ICE scoring method).

Simplicity might have different meanings in different contexts. A solution that can be implemented rapidly and easily might not make the implemented feature easy to use for a long time or might not fix a bug thoroughly.

We need to combine the simplicity factor with other factors to evaluate the value of a solution. So, in this step, we should only consider the **simplicity** factor in the context of **how easy and fast a solution can be implemented** to estimate the **ease** score from 1 to 10.

Again, reusability might have different meanings in different contexts. A reusable code might not make the feature it implements reusable across multiple contexts with little or no modification required.

In this step, we should only consider the **reusability** factor in terms of **how much time a solution can be used without code modification** to estimate the **confidence** score from 1 to 10.

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (1) (1).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

We can use the **flexibility** factor to estimate **how instant and easy a solution can handle changes in requirements** to score the **impact** element from 1 to 10.

{% hint style="info" %}
After evaluating **impact**, **confidence**, and **ease** scores, you can sum up these three scores to produce the final ICE score for every solution. Then, you can use the ICE scores to find the simplest and most effective solution.
{% endhint %}

After concluding the simplest and most effective solution, we need to consider the required time-to-market (the due date of the Jira issue) before making the final decision.

{% hint style="info" %}
The simplest and most effective solution is usually the solution that is **overall** and can be used for **a long time** without the need to update and redistribute code. But, if limited by the time-to-market, we can **temporarily** implement another solution that needs less time. Then, implement the overall and long-term solution **later**.
{% endhint %}

&#x20;If you cannot make a final decision, don't be afraid to discuss it with your teammates or leaders for more points of view.

{% hint style="info" %}
After making the final decision, you need to submit a solution proposal. Open [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8IcTnfy\_6Y92hScpEwUMpfWXQengWYQtxPXiXPbmStBWilw/viewform), fill in the information you found in [step 1](1.-understand-the-issue.md), [step 2](2.-find-multiple-solutions.md), and [step 3](3.-choose-one-solution.md) then submit the form. Wait for your solution proposal to be approved before continuing to [step 4](4.-write-automated-tests.md).
