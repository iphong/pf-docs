# 2. Find multiple solutions

After understanding the issue, itâ€™s time to find feasible solutions. If the time is limited, you should try to find at least two solutions.

{% hint style="success" %}
When finding solutions, we must ensure the **app's stability**. Thus, every solution should **not affect** other functionalities of the app.
{% endhint %}

Except for things that are simple in nature, like changing text copy, most problems can have more than one solution.

You can start with the most direct way to accomplish the most basic requirement as the first solution. Then, gradually refine it to find more solutions to achieve the desired goal.

You also can brainstorm with your teammates to have different points of view.
