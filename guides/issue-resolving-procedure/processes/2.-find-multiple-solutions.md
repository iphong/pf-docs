# 2. Find multiple solutions

After understanding the issue, itâ€™s time to find feasible solutions. If the time is limited, you should try to find at least two solutions.

{% hint style="info" %}
When finding solutions, we must ensure the app's stability. Thus, every solution should **not depend** on other functionalities to work as intended and should **not affect** other app features.
{% endhint %}

Except for a simple requirement, like changing text copy, we always have more than one solution to resolve an issue.

You can start with the most direct way to accomplish the most basic requirement as the first solution. Then, gradually refine it to find more solutions to achieve the desired goal.

We will evaluate each solution in the next step. So, in this step, don't limit yourself to anything. When your mind is free, ideas will come up easier.
