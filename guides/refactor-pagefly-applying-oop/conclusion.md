# Conclusion

For a deeper understanding of the new structure and adapters, I recommend you check out the `cuongnm-refactoring-oop` branch of the `pfcore` repository and read the source code files under the `src/next/@refactoring` directory.

Refactoring PageFly from functional to object-oriented programming is like renovating and embellishing ancient architecture. What I have done is only propose a material alternative. Replacing old materials with new ones while keeping the beauty and functionalities of ancient architecture is much more difficult. Therefore, the most important to complete this work is your contribution.

The new structure and adapters I've created so far are based on common functions and might not be able to cover individual cases. While refactoring the app, if you see something in the base functions and classes I've created that can be improved or needs to be updated, please do not hesitate to propose your solution to the team.

Let's work together for a better performance and bug-free PageFly!
