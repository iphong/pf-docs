# Apply the OOP concept to refactor PageFly

Functional programming and object-oriented programming are two different techniques. So, to refactor PageFly applying OOP, I've created a new structure. Besides the new structure, I've also created some adapters for a seamless combination of refactored and non-refactored code. The adapters will ensure PageFly functions like normal while being refactored.
